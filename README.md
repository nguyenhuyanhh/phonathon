# phonathon

The system aims to provide a modern and free alternative to the current Campuscall system used in Phonathon.

This document provides an overview of the project.

## Early choices

- The system would be implemented in Django 1.11, using Python 3.5+ and Linux
- A prototype would be hosted locally (using the Django development server), and if possible on Google Cloud/ DigitalOcean

## Early hindrances

- Django is best suited for deployment on a Linux-based server (which NTU lacks)

## Early focus

- Getting a minimum working example for presentation
